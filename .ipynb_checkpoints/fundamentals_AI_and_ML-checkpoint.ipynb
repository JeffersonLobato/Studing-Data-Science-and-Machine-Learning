    "<h1>Fundamentals of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to develop systems capable of performing tasks that were previously exclusive to human intelligence. These systems are able to learn from data, which is why AI is often associated with Machine Learning.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms and models that enable the analysis of data and identification of patterns. With these algorithms, computers can learn to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine Learning is used in various areas, such as voice recognition, image classification, fraud detection, among others. The growing amount of data available and the advancement of Machine Learning techniques have contributed to the creation of increasingly sophisticated and efficient systems.</p>\n",

    "<h2>Basic types of machine learning algorithms</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where the input data is labeled with the correct output. The algorithm learns from this labeled data to predict the output of new, unseen data. In supervised learning, the algorithm is being supervised to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs in order to make accurate predictions for new data.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm where there are no labeled data or known outputs. Instead, the algorithm tries to find patterns and structures in the input data. The goal is to discover hidden relationships and insights that can be used to group or segment the data in a useful way. Unsupervised learning is used in many applications, such as cluster analysis, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique in which an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, depending on its actions, and uses this feedback to adjust its behavior. The goal is to find the optimal action policy, which maximizes the accumulated reward over time. Reinforcement learning is used in many applications, such as games, robotics, and decision-making.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Regression Algorithm</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The regression algorithm is a type of machine learning algorithm used to predict a numerical value based on historical data. It analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables to create a mathematical equation that can be used to predict future values. Regression is commonly used in prediction problems, such as predicting the price of a house based on its features. There are several types of regression algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, and polynomial regression.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Classification Algorithm</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The classification algorithm is a type of machine learning algorithm used to categorize data into pre-defined classes. It examines the features of the input data and compares them with labeled training data to identify patterns and relationships. The goal is to build a model capable of classifying new data based on the information learned during training. Classification algorithms are widely used in applications such as spam detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis. There are several types of classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Decision Making Policy</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Decision Making Policy is a process by which a choice is made between several alternatives based on established criteria. In Artificial Intelligence, the Decision Making Policy is usually used in conjunction with Reinforcement Learning to teach an agent to make the best decision in an uncertain environment. The Decision Making Policy can be deterministic or stochastic, and the goal is to maximize the expected return. There are various algorithms and techniques for Decision Making Policy, including the use of Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Linear Programming.</p>\n",

    "<h2>Challenges of Machine Learning Models</h2>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Insufficient amount of data</li>\n",
    "    <li>Non-representative training data</li>\n",
    "    <li>Low data quality</li>\n",
    "    <li>Irrelevant features</li>\n",
    "    <li>Overfitting x Underfitting</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems in machine learning. Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data, meaning that it has memorized the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs poorly on new, unseen data. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data and performs poorly on both the training and test data. The goal of machine learning is to find a balance between these two problems so that the model is able to generalize well to new data.</p>\n",
